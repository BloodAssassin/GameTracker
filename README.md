# Notice
The app is left running in background if you quit the main form, to quit the app you need to close it in the 'System Tray'.<br>
You can't run multiple instances of the app.

You need to select an .exe of a game you want to track.<br>
The game will remain tracked even if you change the location of the .exe, though "(path changed)" status message will appear below the game.
